Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL database

# Node.js & MySQL

## Technical Notes

I've created an Amazon-like storefront that utilize a MySQL database to display a list of products. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. In the end the customer will be displayed a total price based upon the product selected and the quantity they wish to purchase.
